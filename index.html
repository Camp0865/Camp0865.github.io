  <!-- I know inline styles are outdated, but I can't stand looking at just a base HTML page. Sir, it's so ugly! I gotta at least give it a bit of colour! D:! Also, I hope you don't mind, but I did this before classes started. I've also already started on assignment one and I'm halfway finished. I'll be sending it in for revisons soon. I hope that's alright, too!  -->

         Hello there! It's nice to meet you, my name is Natalia Campbell, and I'm a <span style="color: darkslateblue;">first year Interactive Media Design</span> student. I'm just starting my second semester after we had our Christmas break! Seeing as I am a giant nerd, over the break I watched a bunch of videos on <span style="color: darkslateblue;">clipping mask properties</span> of  CSS, and <span style="color: darkslateblue;">SVG</span> image clipping in CSS. I also researched some more tutorial videos and checked out the current UI design trend of glass morphism. I know, not terribly exciting, but I found it fun nonetheless! <span style="color: darkslateblue;">:D</span>
